When you first enable Cloud Services on NetApp HCI, the installation process enables a 90-day trial license for the NetApp Cloud Volumes Service backend. After that time elapses, you must convert the trial license to a production license for continued use.

Information about your license appears in the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control banner.

You can upload the NetApp license file (.nlf) using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control.
== Steps

. Open a web browser and log in to https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^].
. Access the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control [include link to Accessing HCC topic.]
. From the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control banner, click the *Upload a license* link.
+The NetApp Cloud Central page appears: [goes to https://cloud.netapp.com/pricing]
. From the NetApp Cloud Central page, update the license information.
+The updated license information is displayed in the NetApp Cloud Control banner.
